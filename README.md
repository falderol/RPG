# RPG Repository
This repository contains a bunch of stuff that i am working on for RPG's. I'll add things as i remember. Not all of it will be code
Some of this code is autogenerated by another function not in this repository. It should be obvious what it is when you see it, it is the stuff that i would be crazy to type.

## Demagus True Reference

## General
### Flags
Flags are used to be more specific about the area that something is in. I.E. if whatevers using the flags is in a magical frontier forest the flag value would be 49.

|**Bit 11**  |**Bit 10**  |**Bit 09**  |**Bit 08**  |**Bit 07**  |**Bit 06**  |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
|Urban       |Rural       |Agriculture |Pious       |Mining      |Industrial  |

|Forest      |Frontier    |Exotic      |Wealthy     |Costal      |Magical     |


## Shop Generator
`.\test shopGen <filename.txt> <shop number> <flags>`

The shop generator generates the type of shop specified by the shop number, with a semi-random stock.

### Shop Number Key
| Shop # | Shop Type | Shop # | Shop Type |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
00 | Adventurer's Emporium | 08 | Fletcher
01 | Alchemist's Shop | 09 | General Store
02 | Arcana Shop | 10 | Leatherworker's Shop
03 | Bakery | 11 | Music Store
04 | Barber | 12 | Tailor
05 | Blacksmith | 13 | Tavern
06 | Bookstore | 14 | Shrine
07 | Butcher's Shop | 15 | Jeweler

## Settlement Generator
`.\test settlementGen <filename.txt> <size> <flags>`

`.\test autoSettlementGen <filename.txt> <flags>`

Settlements are generated in ascii.

Settlement size can be set manually in a range from 1 to 100, or chosen automatically.


### Key

Each symbol on the map represents a 5 foot x 5 foot square, or one tile.

|Symbol| Meaning
|:-:|:-----------:|
| . | Empty Space |
| H | Road        |
| W | Water       |

# Simple Compile and Run
## Compile
On systems without make

`gcc -o test .\nameGen.c .\convertFromCp.c .\onesCount.c .\itoa.c .\shopGen.c .\settlementGen.c .\test.c`

On systems with make

`make all`

## Run
`.\test <command name> <command arguments>`

## Convert Output to Image
The map is about 7168x6640 if you want to convert it from its .txt form to an image. I recomend you dont use the full file, as the length varies with the shop amount, and shop contents aren't very useful as an image. In other words, use the text files to find stuff, and the image if you need to import the map.
### Linux
You might have to change the imagemagik policy settings.

`sudo convert -size 7168x6640 xc:white -font "FreeMono" -pointsize 12 -fill black -annotate +15+15 "@filenameMap.txt" filename.png`

# Notes
I'm trying to make this work on windows an linux. If you run into an issue on either O.S. let me know.

I'd love to eventaully put this all on a website. I just need to learn how to do web stuff first.

This code is something i'm working on in my free time, for fun.
