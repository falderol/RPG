# RPG Repository
This repository contains a bunch of stuff that i am working on for RPG's. I'll add things as i remember. Not all of it will be code
Some of this code is autogenerated by another function not in this repository. It should be obvious what it is when you see it.
# Contents
  1. Demagus True Reference - A general reference for medieval RPG's and the like
  2. Test.c - A rough sketch of the code that i am currently working on. In other words things i am testing.
  3. shopGen.c - A rough piece of code that randomly generates the specified shop
  4. settlementGen.c - A rough piece of code that randomly generates a full settlement, with shops
# Simple Compile and Run
## Compile
`gcc -o settlementGen .\nameGen.c .\convertFromCp.c .\onesCount.c .\itoa.c .\shopGen.c .\settlementGen.c .\test.c`

I will make a makefile soon

## Run
`.\settlementGen temp.txt 0`
