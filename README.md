# RPG Repository
This repository contains a bunch of stuff that i am working on for RPG's. I'll add things as i remember. Not all of it will be code
Some of this code is autogenerated by another function not in this repository. It should be obvious what it is when you see it, it is the stuff that i would be crazy to type.
# Contents
  1. Demagus True Reference - A general reference for medieval RPG's and the like
  2. test.c - A rough framework for the functions that i am currently working on.
  3. shopGen.c - A rough piece of code that randomly generates the a certain type of shop
  4. settlementGen.c - A rough piece of code that randomly generates a full settlement, with shops. The user can specify the size of the settlement.
  5. nameGen.c - A rough piece of code with a couple random name generators.
  6. convertFromCP.c - A piece of code that converts copper pieces into other currencies.
## Demagus True Reference

## General
### Flags
Flags are used to be more specific about the area that something is in. I.E. if whatevers using them is in a magical frontier forest the flag value would be 49.

Bit 00 - Magical

Bit 01 - Costal

Bit 02 - Rich

Bit 03 - Exotic

Bit 04 - Frontier

Bit 05 - Forest

Bit 06 - Industrial

Bit 07 - Mining

Bit 08 - Pious

Bit 09 - Agriculture

Bit 10 - Rural

Bit 11 - Urban

## Shop Generator
`.\test shopGen <filename.txt> <shop number> <flags>`

The shop generator generates the type of shop specified by the shop number, with a semi-random stock.

### Shop Number Key
00 - Adventurer's Emporium

01 - Alchemist's Shop

02 - Arcana Shop

03 - Bakery

04 - Barber

05 - Blacksmith

06 - Bookstore

07 - Butcher's Shop 

08 - Fletcher

09 - General Store

10 - Leatherworker's Shop

11 - Music Store

12 - Tailor

13 - Tavern

14 - Shrine

15 - Jeweler

## Settlement Generator
`.\test settlementGen <filename.txt> <size> <flags>`

`.\test autoSettlementGen <filename.txt> <flags>`

Settlements are generated in ascii.

Settlement size can be set manually in a range from 1 to 100, or chosen automatically.


### Key

Each symbol on the map represents a 5 foot x 5 foot square, or one tile.

. - Empty Space

H - Highway

W - Water

# Simple Compile and Run
## Compile
On systems without make

`gcc -o test .\nameGen.c .\convertFromCp.c .\onesCount.c .\itoa.c .\shopGen.c .\settlementGen.c .\test.c`

On systems with make

`make all`

## Run
`.\test <command name> <command arguments>`

## Convert Output to Image
The map is about 7168x6640 if you want to convert it from its .txt form to an image. I recomend you dont use the full file, as the length varies with the shop amount, and shop contents aren't very useful as an image. In other words, use the text files to find stuff, and the image if you need to import the map.
### Linux
You might have to change the imagemagik policy settings.

`sudo convert -size 7168x6640 xc:white -font "FreeMono" -pointsize 12 -fill black -annotate +15+15 "@filenameMap.txt" filename.png`

# Notes
I'm trying to make this work on windows an linux. If you run into an issue on either O.S. let me know.

I'd love to eventaully put this all on a website. I just need to learn how to do web stuff first.

This code is something i'm working on in my free time, for fun.
