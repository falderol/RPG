# RPG Repository
This repository contains a bunch of stuff that i am working on for RPG's. I'll add things as i remember. Not all of it will be code
Some of this code is autogenerated by another function not in this repository. It should be obvious what it is when you see it, it is the stuff that i would be crazy to type.

## Demagus True Reference

## General
### Flags
Flags are used to be more specific about the area that something is in. I.E. if whatevers using the flags is in a magical frontier forest the flag value would be 49.

|**Bit 11**  |**Bit 10**  |**Bit 09**  |**Bit 08**  |**Bit 07**  |**Bit 06**  |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
|Urban       |Rural       |Agriculture |Pious       |Mining      |Industrial  |
|**Bit 05**  |**Bit 04**  |**Bit 03**  |**Bit 02**  |**Bit 01**  |**Bit 00**  |
|Forest      |Frontier    |Exotic      |Wealthy     |Costal      |Magical     |


## Shop Generator
`.\test shopGen <filename.txt> <shop number> <flags>`

The shop generator generates the type of shop specified by the shop number, with a semi-random stock.

### Shop Number Key
| Shop # | Shop Type | Shop # | Shop Type |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
00 | Adventurer's Emporium | 08 | Fletcher
01 | Alchemist's Shop | 09 | General Store
02 | Arcana Shop | 10 | Leatherworker's Shop
03 | Bakery | 11 | Music Store
04 | Barber | 12 | Tailor
05 | Blacksmith | 13 | Tavern
06 | Bookstore | 14 | Shrine
07 | Butcher's Shop | 15 | Jeweler

## Settlement Generator
`.\test settlementGen <filename.txt> <size> <flags>`

`.\test autoSettlementGen <filename.txt> <flags>`

Settlements are generated in ascii.

Settlement size can be set manually in a range from 1 to 100, or chosen automatically.

### Key

Each symbol on the map represents a 5 foot x 5 foot square, or one tile.

|Symbol| Meaning
|:-:|:-----------:|
| . | Empty Space |
| H | Road        |
| W | Water       |

## Region Gen

This is the section i am currently working on in my free time. It involves the most fine tunning in a desperate attempt to make a world that always feels right.

You will see a section of code that autogenerates all of the settlements in this region that is being generated. I recomend that your do not use this. It tends to create a text file that is about 750 MiB in size. Instead generate the settlements using `.\test autoSettlementGen <filename.txt> <flags>` where the flags are what you see for the location on the map. Alternatively use `.\test settlementGen <filename.txt> <size> <flags>` if you want to determine the size of the settlement. Trust me, your players will not get to all of the 1000+ settlements that are normaly generated. If you insist on making the full thing you can uncomment and compile the code yourself. I want you to have a little idea what you are doing before you do it.

### Key

Each symbol on the map represents a 1 mile x 1 mile square.

|Symbol| Meaning
|:-:|:-----------:|
| ▓ | Water       |
| ~ | Plains      |
| Δ | Mountain    |

# Simple Compile and Run
## Compile
On systems without make

`gcc -o test .\nameGen.c .\convertFromCp.c .\onesCount.c .\itoa.c .\shopGen.c .\settlementGen.c .\test.c`

On systems with make

`make all`

## Run
`.\test <command name> <command arguments>`

## Convert Output to Image
The map is about 7168x6640 if you want to convert it from its .txt form to an image. I recomend you dont use the full file, as the length varies with the shop amount, and shop contents aren't very useful as an image. In other words, use the text files to find stuff, and the image if you need to import the map.
### Linux
You might have to change the imagemagik policy settings.

`sudo convert -size 6144x6656 xc:white -font "Unifont" -pointsize 12 -fill black -annotate +15+15 "@filename.txt" filename.png`

Don't have Unifont? Download it here http://www.unifoundry.com/unifont.html

Alternitively you can use another monospace font that supports the utf 8 charecter set.

# Notes
I'm trying to make this work on windows an linux. If you run into an issue on either O.S. let me know.

I'd love to eventaully put this all on a website. I just need to learn how to do web stuff first.

This code is something i'm working on in my free time, for fun.
